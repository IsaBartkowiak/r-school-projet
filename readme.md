# Analysis of a dataset with R (school project)


The objective of this project is to understand simple and complex statistical methods. The interest is also to implement the course elements.

The database used represents the tips received by a waiter at an American restaurant in the 1990s. The data was collected by the server for a period of 2 and a half months during the year 1994. This dataset is used as for example in Peter G. Bryant's Practical Data Analysis: Case Studies in Business Statistics, Marlene A. Smith, published in 1995.

The database named Tips has been retrieved from http://www.info.univ-angers.fr/~gh/Datasets/tips.zip, it contains 244 occurrences representing a meal in the restaurant.
